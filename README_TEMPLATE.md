# Keigen

_Keigen is a Kotlin (Android) library for fast matrix operations and linear algebra built on a C++ foundation._

Keigen is an Kotlin wrapper for Eigen, a linear algebra library written in C++.

Keigen is still just on the drawing table, and might stay there for all eternity. Despite that, the
Matrix class is supporting all normal matrix-to-matrix and matrix-to-scalar operations. All
arithmetic operators are covered (+, -, *, /), get by square brackets [row, col], set by square
brackets, transpose, raw data array get/set etc. 

### Artwork

The artwork combines the scholar owl in the Eigen artwork and the Kotlin logo colors. In Keigen,
the owl has obviously found a new cool style, heavily inspired by The Matrix - not to be confused
with _a_ matrix.
