# Keigen

_A matrix and linear algebra library for Android_

Keigen is an Kotlin wrapper for Eigen, a linear algebra library written in C++.

Keigen is still just on the drawing table, and might stay there for all eternity. If so, one can
at least find how to setup Eigen on Android by looking in the /keigen sources :)

### Artwork

The artwork combines the scholar owl in the Eigen artwork and the Kotlin logo colors. In Keigen,
the owl has obviously found a new cool style, heavily inspired by The Matrix - not to be confused
with _a_ matrix.
_The artwork was made by me._
