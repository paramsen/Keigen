# Keigen

_A FFT computation library for Android_

Keigen is an Kotlin wrapper for Eigen, a linear algebra library written in C++.

Keigen is still just on the drawing table, and might stay there for all eternity. If so, one can
at least find how to setup Eigen on Android by looking in the /keigen sources :)
